# Morseduino
##### by Giulia Baldini, Matteo Nardini, Remo Scolati

This project has been developed during the 2016 Arduino Workshop of the faculty of Computer Science at the Free University of Bolzano.

### The Project
This sketch reads the resistance variation of a fotoresistor and interprets it as morse code displaying the received signal as standard text on a LCD display.

For this project, we have started checking with a simple LED and a fotoresistor how we could transmit the signal to another LED. Then, as it worked well fast, we added the LCD screen and a potentiometer, so that we could control the screen's contrast. In the end, when the electronic part was ready, we started implementing the real code for the Arduino. After some measurements, we got to the point were our prototype works without major issues. 

### Folder structure
The **sketch** folder contains the sketches used by the project. The **schematics** folder contains the visual and technical schematics of the project.
